# The Aavesome list

The Aavesome list is a community-driven project, designed to be a resource people can use to familiarize themselves with Aave Protocol ecosystem. All are welcome to contribute.

**Credits**

This list is inspired by the community initiative of MakerDao [the Awesome-list](https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao)

**Get Started**

Those interested in Aave Protocol are invited to explore the Aavesome list collection of resources below. Get to know Aave with the help of beginner guides, official documentation, White paper, analysis pieces, tools, partnership announcements, AMAs, podcasts, and third-party apps, and more.

**Please Be Advised**

Users are ***strongly encouraged*** to perform their own due diligence before trusting third-party services listed below. Despite Aave's best efforts to curate a clean resource, given the nature of the cryptocurrency realm, scams do exist, and even great projects are frequently compromised.
